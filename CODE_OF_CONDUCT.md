## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Regarding System Administration Tools

As this project deals with system-level Windows modifications, please keep in mind:

1. **Safety First**
   - Always discuss potential risks before suggesting changes
   - Test thoroughly in isolated environments
   - Document any potential side effects

2. **User Responsibility**
   - Remind users about the "use at your own risk" nature
   - Don't assume everyone has administrator privileges
   - Provide clear warnings about registry modifications

3. **Ethical Use**
   - This tool should only be used on systems you own or have permission to modify
   - Don't assist others in unauthorized system modifications
   - Report any malicious use cases

4. **Clear Communication**
   - Explain technical concepts in accessible language
   - Provide examples and documentation
   - Be patient with beginners

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the project team at:

- **GitHub Issues** (for non-sensitive issues)
- **Email**: [YOUR-EMAIL]
- **Discussions**: GitHub Discussions tab

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting, please provide:
- Your contact information
- Names (real, usernames, nicknames) of any individuals involved
- Description of the incident (including dates, times, and locations)
- Any supporting documentation (screenshots, logs, etc.)
- Any additional context you believe is relevant

## Confidentiality

share information with those who need to know to resolve the issue.
